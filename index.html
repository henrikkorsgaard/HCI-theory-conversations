        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>HCI theory conversations is a series of casual conversations about theory relevant to human-computer
            interaction of all shapes and sizes. The aim is to start a conversation about theory and theoretical work in
            HCI. Not to make the claim that this is not already happening (check the resources), but to facilitate a
            more open conversation about HCI flavoured theories and perhaps how we can generate more theory. That&#39;s
            it for now!</p>
        <p>The idea originates in multiple twitter conversations on theory, discussions at the watercooler and late
            night rants, and a few discussion in research papers and related talks. </p>
        <h2>How to get in on the action?</h2>
        <p>Dates for the conversations will be announced here and on twitter. All you have to do is respond and then you
            will get a link to the online meeting. </p>
        <p>You might want to prepare a bit by grapping a hot or cold beverage. Pen and paper is also nice. And if you
            want to share some resources, please do so as well.</p>
        <h2>Ok, so what do you mean by theory?</h2>
        <p>Whoa, straight to the definitions eh? Ok, I guess before jumping into a zoom with people who like to discuss
            theory, some common defintions might be useful. </p>
        <p>So, for now, lets begin with two perspectives on theory. First, theories are just <em>ideas</em> proposed as
            a way to discuss, examine, explain or bring some order to aspects and phenomenon within human-computer
            interaction. Second, and this is where it gets exciting, theory as a process. If we have theoretical ideas,
            then the fun part is to figure out how these ideas move from being musings and diagrams on a whiteboard
            somewhere to being part of a broader conversation. </p>
        <p>TL:DR; The focus of our conversations start with theories as ideas and theory development as a process. </p>
