        <h4>HCI discussions on theory</h4>
        <p><strong>Rogers, Y. (2004). New theoretical approaches for human‚Äêcomputer interaction. <em>Annual review of
                    information science and technology</em>, <em>38</em>(1), 87-143.</strong></p>
        <p>Rogers discussing different implications of HCI theory from the perspective of practitioners. One of the
            points she makes is that while practitioners are familiar with HCI theory, they often find the theories
            overly complex and cumbersome to apply with little result. Note the focus here is on &quot;classical&quot;
            theories such as usability analysis, activity theory, ecological psycology and distributed cognition
            <em>and</em> the relevance and application for UX practitioners around 2000.</p>
        <p><strong>Rogers, Y. (2011). Interaction design gone wild: striving for wild theory. <em>interactions</em>,
                <em>18</em>(4), 58-62.</strong></p>
        <p>Rogers argue that HCI should turn away from lab studies and engage with research <em>in the wild</em>. With
            this, HCI should focus on importing and developing theories that can account for the various settings in the
            wild. </p>
        <p><strong>Rogers, Y. (2012). HCI theory: classical, modern, and contemporary. <em>Synthesis lectures on
                    human-centered informatics</em>, <em>5</em>(2), 1-129.</strong></p>
        <p>Roger&#39;s book on HCI theory. Quick read. Good for getting an overview on established HCI theory and
            perhaps the relation to the challenges the theories was a response to.</p>
